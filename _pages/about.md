Nattapat (or simply Nat) is currently a 4th year PhD Candidate in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research interests lie within an intersection of different disciplines such as Human-Centered Computing, Behavioural Science, Cognitive Psychology, and Physiological Sensing. My PhD research is specifically interested in **Quantifying, Understanding, and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).**

Human mental models are heavily influenced by [Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) -- systematic patterns of deviation from the norm of rational decision-making, resulting from the unconscious use of mental shortcuts to effectively sift through day-to-day decision-making. When interacting with computing systems and user interfaces, human users face a sheer amount of information and pressure to make quick decisions. Many real-world HCI scenarios suggest that computing systems can trigger and capitalise on cognitive biases; for example, the spread of misinformation, overreliance on AI explanation, dark patterns, or social engineering. 

In my PhD work with my supervisors [Tilman Dingler](http://www.tilmanification.com), [Benjamin Tag](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/852535-benjamin-tag), and [Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/), I explore **the notion of cognitive biases in HCI** -- how they can be reliably quantified, how they manifest in the interact with computers, and how to effectively mitigate their undesired effects.

A brief summary of my PhD work:
* I apply physiological methods -- Near Infrared Technology (fNIRs), Electrodomal Activity (EDA), and Eye-Tracking -- to measure the effects of cognitive biases when reading ideologically polarised short-information (e.g., tweets). Due to the unconscious nature of cognitive biases, physiological measures offer a more objective way to quantify cognitive biases.

* I study individual and contextual factors of how do people are susceptible to confirmation bias. I applied a range of psychometrics (e.g., Cognitive Reflection Test) and self-reports in opinion-reading tasks and measured the effects of confirmation bias through information recall, seeking, and interpretation.

* I map out research in HCI around the issue of cognitive biases.

Prior to that, he completed an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, where he worked with [Proadpran Punyabukkana](mailto:proadpran.p@chula.ac.th) in his final years on Technologies for People with Visual disabilities. Nattapat then moved to Japan and earned a Master of Information Science at Osaka University, where he worked with [Masayuki Numao](mailto:numao@ai.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp) and [Tsukasa Kimura](https://tsukasakimura.wixsite.com/home/english). During his time in Japan, Nattapat collaborated on a wide range of interdisciplinary projects and developed his research interest in cognition-aware computing and physiological data analysis (i.e. EEG, ECG, EDA).
