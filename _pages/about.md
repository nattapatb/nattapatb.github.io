Nattapat is currently a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He is working on **the Quantification and Mitigation of Cognitive Biases in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Contexts.** In addition, he is interested in Cognition-Aware Computing and Empatic Computing -- understanding and assessing human cognitive states by means of physiological sensors. His PhD study is supervised by [Tilman Dingler](http://www.tilmanification.com) and [Benjamin Tag](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/852535-benjamin-tag).

Prior to that, he completed an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, where he worked with [Proadpran Punyabukkana](mailto:proadpran.p@chula.ac.th) in his final years on Technologies for People with Visual disabilities. Nattapat then moved to Japan and earned a Master of Information Science at Osaka University, where he worked with [Masayuki Numao](mailto:numao@ai.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp) and [Tsukasa Kimura](https://tsukasakimura.wixsite.com/home/english). During his time in Japan, Nattapat collaborated on a wide range of interdisciplinary projects and developed his research interest in cognition-aware computing and physiological data analysis (i.e. EEG, ECG, EDA).
