Nattapat (or simply Nat) is currently a 4th year PhD Candidate in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research interests lie within an intersection of different disciplines such as Human-Centered Computing, Behavioural Science, Cognitive Psychology, and Physiological Sensing. My PhD research is specifically interested in **Quantifying, Understanding, and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).**

Beyond my PhD study, I am actively involved in research communities of cognitive bias and physiological computing. I led the organisation of two workshops at premier HCI venues: (1) [Understanding and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Human-AI Collaoration (CSCW '23)](http://critical-media.org/cscw23/) and (2) [Advancing Physiological Methods in Human-Information Interaction (UbiComp/ISWC '24)](https://hii-biosignal.github.io/ubi24/). 

**Nattapat is looking for job opportunities.**

## Background of My Research

Human mental models are heavily influenced by [Cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) -- systematic patterns of deviation from the norm of rational decision-making, resulting from the unconscious use of mental shortcuts to effectively sift through day-to-day decision-making. When interacting with computing systems and user interfaces, human users face a sheer amount of information and pressure to make quick decisions. Many real-world HCI scenarios suggest that computing systems can trigger and capitalise on cognitive biases; for example, the spread of misinformation, overreliance on AI explanation, dark patterns, or social engineering.

In my PhD work with my supervisors [Tilman Dingler](http://www.tilmanification.com), [Benjamin Tag](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/852535-benjamin-tag), and [Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/), I explore **the notion of cognitive biases in HCI** -- how they can be reliably quantified, how they manifest in the interact with computers, and how to effectively mitigate their undesired effects.

A brief summary of my PhD work:

* I apply physiological methods -- Near Infrared Technology (fNIRs), Electrodomal Activity (EDA), and Eye-Tracking -- to measure the effects of cognitive biases when reading ideologically polarised short-information (e.g., tweets). To overcome the unconscious nature of cognitive biases, I s physiological measures offer a more objective way to quantify cognitive biases. **[[Bias-Aware Systems: Exploring Indicators for the Occurrences of Cognitive Biases when Facing Different Opinions (CHI '23 Honourable Mention Award)]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580917)**

* I study individual and contextual factors into how people are susceptible to cognitive biases. The manifestation of cognitive biases are influenced by a pletora of human individual factors and interaction contexts. Therefore, biases are not always pronounced in every individual and scenario. Measured through self-assessments (such as Cognitive Reflection Test and Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scales), I investigate how do individual and contextual factors influence the occurrences of confirmation bias in three information interaction scenarios: seeking, interpreting, and seeking polarising information. 

* Extending the growing discussions in HCI, I map out the field's research around the issue of cognitive biases. Through a systematic literature review of HCI articles investigating cognitive biases (from 2010 to 2024), I document cognitive biases that present in the interaction with computers and how researchers study them from a HCI angle.

Prior to that, I obtained a Master of Information Science and Technology from Osaka University in Japan, where I received the Japanese Government Scholarship (MEXT). My master's thesis titled *Towards Multimodal Office Task Performance Estimation* led me to develop research interests in cognition-aware computing and physiological sensing. Prior to Japan, I completed a Bachelor of Computer Engineering (1st class honours) from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.
