Nattapat (or simply Nat) is currently a 4th year PhD Candidate at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He is working on **Quantifying, Understanding, and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, specifically in the context of social media and misinformation. 

A brief summary of my PhD work:
* I apply physiological methods -- Near Infrared Technology (fNIRs), Electrodomal Activity (EDA), and Eye-Tracking -- to measure the effects of cognitive biases when reading ideologically polarised short-information (e.g., tweets). Due to the unconscious nature of cognitive biases, physiological measures offer a more objective way to quantify cognitive biases.

* I study individual and contextual factors of how do people are susceptible to confirmation bias. I applied a range of psychometrics (e.g., Cognitive Reflection Test) and self-reports in opinion-reading tasks and measured the effects of confirmation bias through information recall, seeking, and interpretation.

His PhD study is supervised by [Tilman Dingler](http://www.tilmanification.com), [Benjamin Tag](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/852535-benjamin-tag), and [Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/).

Prior to that, he completed an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, where he worked with [Proadpran Punyabukkana](mailto:proadpran.p@chula.ac.th) in his final years on Technologies for People with Visual disabilities. Nattapat then moved to Japan and earned a Master of Information Science at Osaka University, where he worked with [Masayuki Numao](mailto:numao@ai.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp) and [Tsukasa Kimura](https://tsukasakimura.wixsite.com/home/english). During his time in Japan, Nattapat collaborated on a wide range of interdisciplinary projects and developed his research interest in cognition-aware computing and physiological data analysis (i.e. EEG, ECG, EDA).
