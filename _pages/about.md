Hi and good day! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My research interests lie within an intersection of different disciplines such as Human-Centred Computing, Behavioural Science, and Physiological Sensing. My research focuses on **Quantifying and Understanding the Effects of Cognitive Biases in Human-Computer Interaction.** My PhD advisors are Tilman Dingler, Benjamin Tag, and Jorge Goncalves.

As a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, my passion is to design and develop technologies that take into account cognitive biases in people, adapt to their complex and constrained mental models, and help them make conscious decisions in the real world.

## Outline of My Research

Modern technologies, such as AI and social media, enable new and complex ways for humans to interact with computers. However, they introduce sheer cognitive demands, time constraints, and ambiguity to users. To cope with such demands, humans apply mental shortcuts or heuristics to sift through information and effectively make decisions. However, these shortcuts result in **[Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)**, which systematically influence behaviour and judgment without one’s awareness. These biases can lead to devastating outcomes for users, for example, falling victim to misinformation, mistrusting or over-relying on AI assistance, and being manipulated by social engineering applications or dark patterns.

My three publications at the CHI conference outline my research around forming a systematic understanding of cognitive biases in HCI, developing methods to quantify their occurrences, and identifying user and interaction contexts that influence their effects:

> **Systematic Understanding of Cognitive Biases in HCI:** I conducted a scoping review of 127 HCI articles that study cognitive biases. Findings suggest computing systems can trigger cognitive biases, as well as provide cognitive assistance to mitigate their undesired effects. These biases introduce real-world concerns, which motivate HCI researchers to develop tools and methods to closely study their impact on HCI. The understanding of cognitive biases allows designers to take these biases into account, mitigate the undesired biases, and leverage their effects for good.

  > **Quantifying the Occurrences of Cognitive Biases:** Cognitive biases happen without our awareness; therefore, it is a challenge to detect whether it is taking effect in the interaction. Physiological sensing offers a non-intrusive, more objective means to detect user cognitive states. In this study, I deployed physiological measurements (hemodynamic activity, electrodermal activity, and eye-tracking) to detect the occurrences of cognitive biases when users read different text opinions on a polarising, divisive topic (e.g., climate change, feminism, or abortion rights). In this context, users employ heuristics to read text opinions: they rely on the congruence between their ideological beliefs and the stance of the opinion they read. From the data collected, I found significant effects of ideological congruence on hemodynamic activity, particularly in participants who exhibit low involvement in the topic.

  > **Understanding Bias Susceptibility:** Cognitive biases do not always surface in every individual and context. A variety of factors  make people more or less susceptible to biases. Based on information consumption scenarios, I conducted a study that exposed users to tweets on a polarising topic when they seek, evaluate, and recall these tweets. The result shows that factors related to *user characteristics* (thinking style and political belief strength) and *interaction context* (issue strength of the content and task design and modality) influence individuals’ susceptibility to exhibit cognitive biases.

* I apply physiological methods -- Near Infrared Technology (fNIRs), Electrodomal Activity (EDA), and Eye-Tracking -- to measure the effects of cognitive biases when reading ideologically polarised short-information (e.g., opinion tweets about climate change, abortion rights, or feminism). To overcome the unconscious nature of cognitive biases, I conduct a study to explore feasible measures of cognitive biases when people face different opinions. This work paves the first step towards the in-situ detection of cognitive biases. [**[CHI '23 Honourable Mention Best Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580917)**, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgWEPaVPDck&t=1s)]

* I study individual and contextual factors into how people are susceptible to cognitive biases. The manifestation of cognitive biases are influenced by user characteristics and interaction contexts. Therefore, biases are not always pronounced in every individual and scenario. Measured through self-assessments (such as Cognitive Reflection Test and Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scales), I investigate how do individual and contextual factors influence the occurrences of confirmation bias in three information interaction scenarios: seeking, interpreting, and seeking polarising information. [[Accepted at CHI '25](https://nattapatb.github.io/files/chi25-bias-susceptibility.pdf)]

* I map out the field's discussion and research  around the issue of cognitive biases. Through a systematic scoping review of HCI articles investigating cognitive biases (from 2010 to 2024), I document cognitive biases that present in the interaction with computers and chart how researchers study them from the HCI angle. The findings suggest computing systems can be designed to trigger biases in people and manipulate their judgement. Meanwhile, the very same technologies can be used for mitigating undesired effects of cognitive biases. Therefore, HCI researchers study these biases to derive designs of technologies that take into account biases in people and computing systems. **[[CHI '25 Honourable Mention Best Paper](https://nattapatb.github.io/files/chi25-bias-scoping-review.pdf)]**

* I sketch out a **[research agenda](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10142163)** for designing technologies to support critical thinking in people and fortify them from misinformation and online manipulation. I document the discussions in three workshops and formulate HCI-side solutions that help limit the spread of misinformation through user interfaces and effective interventions that foster deliberate thinking in people and skills they need to conduct themselves online.

Apart from my PhD research, I am actively involved in research communities of cognitive bias and physiological computing. I led the organisation of two successful workshops at premier HCI venues: (1) Understanding and Mitigating Cognitive Biases in Human-AI Collaboration ([CSCW '23](http://critical-media.org/cscw23/)) and (2) Advancing Physiological Methods in Human-Information Interaction ([UbiComp/ISWC '24](https://hii-biosignal.github.io/ubi24/)).

I previously obtained a Master of Information Science and Technology from Osaka University in Japan, where I received the Japanese Government Scholarship (MEXT). [My master's thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9283107) titled *Towards Multimodal Office Task Performance Estimation* led me to develop research interests in cognition-aware computing and physiological sensing. Before that, I completed a Bachelor of Computer Engineering (1st class honours) from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.
